Issues:
	Divide/exponentiate methods won't work until exponent and fraction are implemented
	.negative() affects the object it's called upon, which leads to some funky results
	Expression.simplify() doesn't work
	
	Logarithm/Exponent/Fraction aren't implemented
		- Hopefully you can look at the code and see what needs to be done
		
	Recursive step is not yet implemented
	Shunting yard evaluator not yet implemented
